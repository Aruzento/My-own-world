# Product Dashboard

Updated: 2026-10-01

## Current Product

MyOwnWorld is a local-first worldbuilding OS for tabletop campaigns. It combines cards, campaign maps, presentation mode, task trackers, wiki links, assets, backups, desktop packaging and rule/character foundations in one workspace format.

The earlier foundation phases and Phase 16 remain closed. CTV Stages 1–9 are DONE / Foundation; CTV migration is CLOSED. Schema → Variables/Entity → domains → Inspector/Sheet/Combat/Map is the production architecture. Properties survives only as inert migration/recovery/old-format support. Registry owns the fifteen formal types; new cards are structured. Type change, duplicate/Templates v2/World Package v2, Backup v2/partial restore and typed assets/search/derived graph references share guarded canonical boundaries. Settings exposes explicit migration/adoption/retirement and recovery. Combat 17.6/Undo remains accepted; 17.7 is UNBLOCKED / NEXT, NOT STARTED. No automatic migration, Effects Engine or new Combat mechanics were introduced.

## Current Focus

Active plan: `docs/01-delivery/PROJECT_PLAN.md`.

Immediate direction:

1. Use `docs/01-delivery/PROJECT_PLAN.md` as the only active implementation roadmap.
2. Treat `0.0.1.10.0` cleanup as closed after the corrective final gate.
3. Closed cleanup leaves so far: `RCB-021`, `RCB-001`, `RCB-001B`, `RCB-002`, `RCB-003`, `RCB-022`, `RCB-004`, `RCB-005`, `RCB-016`, `RCB-023`, `RCB-024`, `RCB-025`, `RCB-006A`, `RCB-006B`, `RCB-006C`, `RCB-007A`, `RCB-007B`, `RCB-007C`, `RCB-007D`, `RCB-026`, `RCB-027`, `RCB-017`, `RCB-018`, `RCB-019`, `RCB-028`, `RCB-008`, `RCB-009`, `RCB-010`, `RCB-020`, `RCB-011`, `RCB-012`, `RCB-013`, `RCB-014`, `RCB-015`, `RCB-029` and `RCB-030`.
4. Treat `0.0.1.11.0` Existing P1 Stabilization as closed after the final gate passed on 2026-08-24.
5. Treat `0.0.1.12.0` Data Safety Completion as closed after the final gate passed on 2026-08-24.
6. Treat `0.0.1.15.0` NF-003 Event / Roll / Combat Log + Transactions as closed after the final gate passed on 2026-08-28.
7. Closed phase: `0.0.1.16.0` Persistent Combat Session is `DONE` after 16.FINAL PASS on 2026-09-13.
8. Paused phase: `0.0.1.17.0` Combat Action Pipeline after accepted `17.6`; 17.7 is UNBLOCKED / NEXT, NOT STARTED; later Combat tasks retain their own dependencies.
9. Keep current design accepted for this stage; final visual polish returns later when mature workflows exist.
10. Keep project documentation readable for the product owner, not only for Codex.

Dated delivery evidence is in [dated implementation history](../archive/documentation-2026-09-15/PRODUCT_DASHBOARD_HISTORY.md); use the active plan for current state.

Next owner action:

- CTV is CLOSED. The next separately authorized task may start Combat 17.7; this task does not start it. Ambiguous legacy evidence requires explicit review, never guessed conversion. Non-core Player editors remain Inspector-owned; Effects Engine/equipment are future product work.

## Readiness Model

Task status must use the readiness levels from `docs/01-delivery/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`:

- `Foundation` - useful base exists, but the human workflow is not complete.
- `MVP` - a basic user path exists and is testable.
- `Usable` - the owner can use it in normal work, with persistence and known risks handled.
- `Release-ready` - ready for handoff after automated and manual release checks.

This prevents "done" from meaning only "a model/helper was created".

## Key Risks

- Large real workspaces can still expose UI delay, especially in map-heavy sessions; the measurable and native `X:\ДНД\Мастер\По кампаниям\База` passes are currently green.
- Page lifecycle now has `PageCommandService`, `PageRecord`, trash/undo, PageIndex lifecycle, runtime write revision protection, optimistic edit-session conflict protection, workspace access diagnostics and grouped recovery/asset/link diagnostics. Dice rolls have a canonical public facade. Phase 15 provides typed durable history, Phase 16 provides session audit integration, and Phase 17 retains durable single-target attack execution, supported compensation and the first popup workflow as Foundation work. Its manual acceptance is deferred while the new declarative card-type, Variables and universal Inspector architecture is built.
- Desktop release/native verification is currently green, but native click-through, packaging smoke and large-workspace smoke must stay part of release handoff.
- Campaign map presentation and drawing tools are currently verified for their focused matrices; fog/layers and music still require continued regression coverage.
- Structured Character/Player models and canonical health power Sheet/Map/Combat. Release-ready workflow polish remains future product work; active Properties ownership is retired.
- Knowledge Graph Phase 7 is now usable as a migrated canvas workbench with CSS/JS ownership split and command-lifecycle relationship persistence. The remaining risk is product direction, not hidden migration plumbing: `BI-026` should rethink what the graph helps a GM decide before new visible graph features.
- The active plan owns phase/leaf status; update a product summary or bug record only when its own scope becomes inaccurate.
